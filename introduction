- What is C#?
    - Modern Programming Language
    - Object Oriented
    - type safe programming language:
        - enforces strict type checks at compile time and runtime, ensuring that variables are used in accordance with their declared types. This helps avoid errors and improve security.
        ```sql
        int number = 5;         // OK: 5 is an int
        string name = "John";   // OK: "John" is a string
        number = "hello";       // ‚ùå Error: Cannot assign string to int
        ```
        - python is dynamically typed so it is not type-safe
    - Secure and Robust
    - it runs in .NET ECOSYSTEM
    - it comes from C language:
    - Good with Software Design Practices:
        - Solid Principles
        - Design Patterns
        - OOP concepts
